# 👋 Hey, I’m @foxlldev!
       I'm the founder and current owner of Withered (www.withered.app).
       👀 I’m interested in modding games, mainly Minecraft. I’m currently learning Python.
       💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything.
       I realise most of my work on here is archived, outdated and generally just a bad showcase of my work. I'll be uploading some of my more recent projects, like the Withered v1.0 website (an old work but still good). And, most of my bad work will be deleted - sorry!
